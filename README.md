* The code was built for Old QBCore, you can of course change it to new if you want. (If you need help feel free to ask)
* When you go into the nc-codes folder make sure in 100% that you change from ```NCCore``` to your Core.
* When you go into the nc-codebot folder (which is actually the folder of the bot that you put in your server) make sure you edit everything in config.js and also in index.js
* In the nc-codebot folder you will need to edit within the config.js the ```"token", "logo", "community_name", "role_access_id", and all the details of the database_```
* In the nc-codebot folder you will need to edit inside the index.js line 104 - ```let logs = client.channels.cache.get ('Put Here Your Channel ID')```. All codes created will be in the channel of your choice.
